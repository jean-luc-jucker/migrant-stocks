What's in this repo?
Some visualisations on the evolution of international migrant stocks from 1990 to 2019.

What are international migrant stocks?
The number of people born in another country than the country in which they live, including, for example, migrants and refugees.

Where do the data come from?
The data were published by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), here: https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates19.asp, and were made available under a Creative Commons license CC BY 3.0 IGO: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/igo/. You can find a copy of it in the 'data' folder above.

What's in each folder/file?
I'd advise you start with 'unfpa.md', which contains all the visualisations.
-'data' contains the raw data
-'rda' contains the clean data, both in rda. and csv. format
-'unfpa.R' contains the code used to wrangle the data
-'analysis.R' contains the code used to plot the data

Is this a work in progress?
Yes! I'm adding plots on a regular basis.
