I use data from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to visualize the evolution of international migrant stocks between 1990 and 2019.

What are international migrant stocks?
Simply put, the number of migrants and refugees in a given country. More precisely, the number of people born in a country other than that in which they live.

Where do the data come from?
The data were published by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), here: https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates19.asp, and were made available under a Creative Commons license CC BY 3.0 IGO: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/igo/. You can find a copy of it in the 'data' folder of this repo.

I advise you first take a look at 'unfpa.md', which contains the visualizations. I you want to have a look at the code and data:
-'data' contains the raw data
-'rda' contains the clean data, both in .rda and .csv format
-'unfpa.R' contains the code used to wrangle the data
-'analysis.R' contains the code used to plot the data

This is a work in progress. I plan to add soon analyses with migrant stocks in percentage of total population, and also by sex.
